          The world collapsed, but the game survived. In the neon-lit ruins of
          civilization, the last remnants of power aren’t in governments or
          corporations—they’re in the **Oblivion Decks**. Each card carries a
          fragment of lost history, a code of survival, a weapon of deception.
          The elite hoard them. The rebels steal them. The desperate gamble
          their lives for them. Do you have what it takes to **play the game
          that decides the future**?
